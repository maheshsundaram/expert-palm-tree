Python: Min = 0.092s,  Avg = 0.095s,  Max = 0.115s,  Median = 0.093s
Bun:    Min = 26.559s, Avg = 27.354s, Max = 28.233s, Median = 27.423s
Deno:   Min = 39.804s, Avg = 41.218s, Max = 43.831s, Median = 40.649s
Node:   Min = 43.432s, Avg = 46.027s, Max = 47.634s, Median = 46.238s

Python is approximately:

288 times faster than Bun
434 times faster than Deno
484 times faster than Node
